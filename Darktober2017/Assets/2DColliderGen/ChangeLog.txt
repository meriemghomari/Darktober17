===========================================================
  2D ColliderGen - ChangeLog
===========================================================
-----------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.11
-----------------------------------------------------------

New Features:
- Animated Colliders: Added "Remove Frame" feature to
  selectively remove a collider and reference another
  frame's collider instead.
- Animated Colliders: Added a "Sync to Parent Anim"
  parameter under Advanced Settings to allow a child object
  with the same sprite animations but the sprite only
  showing the weapon (for a damage collider) or the body
  (for a hit-collider) and sync perfectly to the main
  animation of the parent.
- New 'IsTrigger' and 'Force Convex' attributes can now be
  used to set all attached collider's attributes at a
  single click.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed initialization when adding an AlphaMeshCollider
  to an animated sprite. Frames are immediately calculated
  or referenced, if the same sprite is already present.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.10
-----------------------------------------------------------

New Features:
- Added Support for UGUI Canvas Images.
  (Note: For now 9-Slice-Sprites are not yet supported.
   If anyone shall need them, send me a feature request.)
   Includes a Demo file showing how to use the feature.
- Adjustible top/bottom/left/right Borders.
  Each border can be adjusted individually, cut and/or
  expanded. Cut and Expand with the same distance can be
  used to reduce jaggy outline noise such as grass
  (Morphological Opening).
  Includes a Demo file showing how to use the feature.

Improvements:
- Improved performance of collider recalculation after
  Alpha Opaque Threshold changes.

Bugfixes:
- Outline generation corrected:
  When the bottom-left-most pixel is at a one-pixel-wide
  L-junction, the generated outline did not include the
  upper part. Fixed now.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.9
-----------------------------------------------------------

Bugfixes:
- Fixed a bug with colliders disappearing in
  RuntimeAlphaMeshCollider when max point count per island
  was larger than the actual number of outline corner
  points of an island.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.8
-----------------------------------------------------------

New Features:
- Added support for EdgeCollider2D.
- RuntimeAlphaMeshCollider now uses a separate processing
  thread for improved performance.
- RuntimeAlphaMeshCollider now supports calculating
  colliders of individual sprite frames or other sprite
  atlas elements on the fly.
  Previously only preprocessed sprites were possible.
  
-----------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.7
-----------------------------------------------------------

New Features:
- Made RuntimeAlphaMeshCollider script more powerful.
- Added preference value "Collider is Trigger" to
  automatically set generated colliders to be triggers.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed 'Component' menu not showing up in latest Unity
  versions.
- Fixed problems with Undo system.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.6
-----------------------------------------------------------

Bugfixes:
- Fixed a bug in serialization/deserialization when
  'development build' was enabled at the PC output target.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.5
-----------------------------------------------------------

Compatibility:
- Fixed a severe problem with Windows Phone 8 build at the
  latest Unity version.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.4
-----------------------------------------------------------

Compatibility:
- Unity5 iOS Mono 2.x compatible again (as well as IL2CPP).

New Features:
- Added collider preference default values for
  alpha threshold, force convex and flip normals.
- Added 'Window' menu entries for Collider Preferences
  window and ColliderGen TK2D Window.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.3
-----------------------------------------------------------

Compatibility:
- Unity5 compatible.
- IL2CPP and iOS-64BIT compatible.

Bugfixes:
- Removed an error console output when changing collider
  type between MeshCollider and PolygonCollider2D.
- Removed Warnings.
  
-----------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.1 and 2.2
-----------------------------------------------------------

Changes:
- Moved all menu items from a top-level "2D ColliderGen"
  entry to "Component/2D ColliderGen". Motivation was to
  comply with the official asset store guidelines.

New Features:
- Multi-Island Editing
  Added support for enabling, disabling and changing the
  outline vertex count of multiple collider islands or
  holes at once.

Bugfixes:
- Custom pivot of Unity 4.3 Sprites is now supported in
  static sprites and animations.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.0
-----------------------------------------------------------

New Features:
- Collider Animation support for Unity 4.3 Sprites
  PolygonCollider2D or MeshColliders can now be
  generated for each animation frame. Automatically
  switches to the corresponding collider at runtime.

Bugfixes:
- Windows Phone compilation issues resolved.
- Several minor bugs removed.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.4
-----------------------------------------------------------

New Features:
- Added support for Unity 4.3 Sprites and PolygonCollider2D
  SpriteRenderer components are now automatically
  recognized by AlphaMeshCollider.
  PolygonCollider2D can now be generated instead of
  MeshColliders as well.

Compatibility:
- Fixed an error with Windows Phone 8 deployment.

Minor Changes:
- Removed warnings of obsolete method calls in Unity4.3.
  
-----------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.3
-----------------------------------------------------------

Compatibility:
- Windows Phone 8 deployment works now.

Minor Changes:
- Removed warnings of obsolete method calls in Unity4.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.2
-----------------------------------------------------------

New Features:
- Added support for unlimited collider-island and –hole
  regions within a single texture image. Islands and holes
  can be enabled and configured via a new
  'Holes and Islands' section.

- Added support for OTTilesSprite. Simply add an
  AlphaMeshCollider to a GameObject with an OTTilesSprite
  component to generate colliders for it.

- Added a "Custom Texture Region" section to the
  AlphaMeshCollider parameters where you can specify a
  custom region to be used for collider computations
  (e.g. to use a custom frame from a texture atlas or
   spritesheet).

Bugfixes:
- SmoothMoves related:
  Collider scale was wrong when setting a custom image at a
  generic object (e.g. a plain quad) which had no
  SmoothMoves or Orthello sprite attached.

  Colliders attached to SmoothMoves BoneAnimation
  sprites can now scale along with it. Added an
  AlphaMeshCollider toggle parameter
  "SmoothMoves Scale Anim" to enable this behaviour.

- 2D Toolkit related:
  Changed the location of the ColliderGenTK2DParameterStore
  code file from Editor to Scripts directory. This prevents
  a problem that occurred with later versions of the Mono
  Compiler. Unfortunately, all ColliderGenParameters.prefab
  files that stored parameters for convenience of each
  sprite in a collection are no longer compatible and will
  be treated as non-existent.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.1
-----------------------------------------------------------

Compatibility:
-  This version is compatible with SmoothMoves V2.2.0 again.
   (Fixed BoneAnimation problems introduced with this
    SmoothMoves version - member variables have changed.)

New Features:
-  Added support for OTTileMap. There is now a menu entry
   "2D ColliderGen/Orthello Specific/Add AlphaMesh Colliders To OTTileMap".

Bugfixes:
-  Previously the bottom-left pixel was not included in the
   outline of objects. This lead to an incorrectly bevelled
   bottom-left corner at a square box (and the outline had
   5 vertices instead of 4).
   
-  Fixed a bug with Alpha Opaque Threshold not being
   synchronized across all instances of a collider-group.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0
-----------------------------------------------------------
-  Initial Release on the Asset Store
